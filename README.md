# AHK
This is a copy of the file that I use for AHK.
I set the script to run on startup in my startup tasks.
These are designed for a mouse with 2 thumb buttons, XButton1 and XButton2. XButton1 is closer to the heel of my hand than XButton 2.
I also designed this to run with the Orseszek timer, Todoist, and Toggl.
In Toggl, I bound ctrl+shift+x to open and close the window, which has a shortcut in RButton+LButton here.
