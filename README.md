The AHK file is my personal mouse and keyboard commands.

The .epf is the eclipse preferenes required for my programming class.

To get the download links:
Go in Versions.
Find the files you want.
Click and drag the links into your bookmarks bar.
Then, when you click the bookmarks, it will send you right to the downlaod, without even having to login to github.

I use this method so that on public computers, I can get all my necessary files and such set up, and running them all from the 
chrome downloads bar at the bottom.

This way, I have all my preferences and shortucts set within one minute of logging into chrome.
Any computer is my personal computer, and I hope to add more scripts going into the future.
